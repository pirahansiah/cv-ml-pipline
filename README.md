Thresholding:
Binarization or thresholding is one problem that have to solve in pattern recognition methods and applications. Moreover, it has a very important influence on the sequent steps in computer vision applications such as, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), image segmentation, and tracking objects.

Binarization or thresholding is one problem that must be solved in pattern recognition and it has a very important influence on the sequent steps in imaging applications. Thresholding is used to separate objects from the background, and diminish the amount of data alter the computational speed. Recently, interest in multilevel thresholding has been altered. However, when the levels are altered, the computation time alters so single threshold methods are accelerated than multilevel methods. Moreover, for every new application, new methods are is acquired.

Thresholding is one of the critical steps in pattern recognition and has a significant effect on the upcoming steps of image application, the important objectives of thresholding are as follows, separating objects from background, decreasing the capacity of data consequently increases speed. Handwritten recognition is one of the important issues, which have various applications in mobile devices.
